<p>Volleyball is a team sport played by two teams on a playing court divided by a net. 
  <br />The sport originated in the United States, and is now just achieving the type of popularity in the U.S. that it has received on a global basis, where it ranks behind only soccer among participation sports.<br /> 
  <br />The object of the game is: for each team to send the ball regularly over the net to ground it on the opponent's court, and to prevent the ball from being grounded on its own court.<br /><br /> The ball is put into play by the right back-row player who serves the ball by hitting it over the net to the opponent's court. A team is allowed to hit the ball three times (in addition to the block contact) to return it to the opponent's court. A player is not allowed to hit the ball twice consecutively, except when attempting a block. The rally continues until the ball touches the ground/floor, goes &quot;out&quot; or a team fails to return it to the opponent's court or commits a fault. <br /><br />The team winning a rally scores a point (Rally Point System). When the receiving team wins a rally, it gains a point and the right to serve, and its players rotate one position clockwise. The best of three or best of five games will win matches. Each non-deciding game will be won by the team that first scores 25 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap). If there is a deciding game, it will be won by the team that first scores 15 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap). <br /><br />
